figure out why the functions aren't being identified

print all values the DLL gets through sockets

add into Hook::deploy_hook check wether that function was selected or not


current problem - 
 - all of the above

 - DLL can't connect to the server until I resume the process
   But than the hooks won't be avialable at start.
 - the SendInfoToDll function doesnt even work, the sock parameter is incorrect.


option how to write the LOG - 

keep all the log messages in a vector. 
After the process is finished running, in DllEntry - 
unload the hooks and write the log to file OR 
send to injectDll, this way it will be easier when graphics are available

DONT FORGET - finish the generic log (by hand), there is a seperate file
