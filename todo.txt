gets stuck in "ResizeAndFixFunctionName" function in Dll, check
the flow of the application, release it where it gets stuck
and make sure the DLL gets the names - done


after that create a file in the dLL that instantly hooks 
all the possiblr functions and change the hook class
so it will only log the stuff wanted



option how to write the LOG - 

keep all the log messages in a vector. 
After the process is finished running, in DllEntry - 
unload the hooks and write the log to file OR 
send to injectDll, this way it will be easier when graphics are available

DONT FORGET - finish the generic log (by hand), there is a seperate file
