CreateFile - 
return an handle to a file of my decision, could be a copy and could be a new file.

DeleteFile - 
copy the file into a file with simmilar name, delete current file, after the program ends recreate the prev file

ReadFile - 
i need to think whether i want to trust the program has a false handle or should i redirect him here as well?

WriteFile - 
same as readfile
