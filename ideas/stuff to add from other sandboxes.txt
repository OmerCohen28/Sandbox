what does kaspersky report - 

	API calls log
	memory dumps
	loaded modules dumps
	chnages in file system and registry
	network traffic (PACP fileS)
	
kasperaky emulates user action so the malware thinks there is an actual user



MUST DO- allow the user to get live feedback (sort of uncompleted log)
